# PythonLibrary
A digital library using Python 

## Overview
PythonLibrary is a digital library application designed to facilitate the management of books and borrowing processes. It leverages Django's powerful features to provide a user-friendly interface for both users and administrators.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure access for users and superusers.
- **Book Management**: Superusers can add, edit, and delete books.
- **Borrowing System**: Users can borrow available books and return them.
- **Book Status Tracking**: Real-time tracking of book availability and user borrowing status.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface for better accessibility.

## Notes
- I had added some CSS, and after removing them, an update did not happen. I solved this by running `python manage.py collectstatic`.
  
- Whitenoise minimizes and compresses static files, while Django Compressor combines multiple static files into one, reducing the number of requests the client makes to the server.

- **Crispy Forms**: Provides easier form rendering, customizable templates, field validation, and integration with Bootstrap.

- The `as_view()` method is specific to class-based views (CBVs), which are a modular way of handling views in Django. If you receive the error `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'as_view'`, it likely means you are using function-based views (FBVs) without converting them to classes. CBVs (like `ListView`, `DetailView`, `CreateView`, etc.) offer a reusable structure ideal for complex views due to built-in functionality and easy inheritance.

- I encountered difficulties with timezones. In PostgreSQL, I ran `SHOW TIMEZONE;` to check my current timezone and `SET TIMEZONE TO 'UTC';` to set it correctly.

- SQL Injection (SQLi) occurs when code incorrectly constructs SQL queries containing user input. Django's ORM uses parameterized statements everywhere, making it highly resistant to SQLi. Thus, if youâ€™re using the ORM for database queries, your app is likely safe. Example of a vulnerable query:
    ```python
    def search(request):
        cursor = db.cursor()
        cursor.execute(
            "SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE title LIKE '%?%'",
            [request.GET['q']]
        )
    ```
